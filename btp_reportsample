Feature Extraction

1. RGB composition -
	. Average Red Pixels : This is calculated by  
	. Average Green Pixels : This is calculated by
	. Average Blue Pixels : This is calculated by
2. Brightness
3. Luminance -
	. Ist : (0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B)
	. IInd : (0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B)
	. IIIrd : sqrt( 0.299*R^2 + 0.587*G^2 + 0.114*B^2 )
4. Anti Blur : 
5. Exposure and Colourfulness : sum(Iv(x,y))*/(X*Y)
6. Saturation : sum(Is(x,y))*/(X*Y)
7. Hue : sum(Ih(x,y))*/(X*Y)
8. Rule of Thirds -
	. On Hue : (9/(X*Y))*
	. On Saturation :
	. On Value :
9. Size and Aspect Ratio -
	. Size : X+Y
	. Aspect Ratio : X/Y
10. Wavelet Based Transform -
	. On Hue -
		. Level 1
		. Level 2
		. Level 3
	. On Saturation -
		. Level 1
		. Level 2
		. Level 3
	. On Value -
		. Level 1
		. Level 2
		. Level 3
11. Low Depth Field of Indicator -
	. On Hue
	. On Saturation
	. On Value
12. Simplicity -
